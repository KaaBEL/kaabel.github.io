I am (so far) a hobbyist programmer. I don't mind learning new languages, but I personally stick to ES5 JavaScript front-end, which I have confident experiences with, naturally counting in also the other language members: HTML + CSS + RegExp + TS, building up various scripts up to few public game related external tools:

### ![D1R DBV editor favicon](./other/d1r_dbv_editor.png) [Droneboi Vehicles editor](https://kaabel.github.io/.d1r.dbv/editor) 
The latest and still actively upadeted project, [Droneboi](https://rizenplanet.com/droneboi.html) is an online free to play mobile space sandbox games series.. While the game studio is busy with core game feature, this external tool attempts to bring the community some rejected editing feauters and better building experience, as a creative person it is a programmatical form of fans art.

### ![warin-extension favicon](./other/warin_extension.png) [Warin Extension](https://github.com/KaaBEL/warin-extension)
[WarIn.Space](http://warin.space) is my most favourite game, it's a teamwork based relaxing space shooter, one of the early .io games. Despite the game not getting a single update in several years, the game and the community is still somewhat active. This chrome extension was created for screenshotting ability inspired by arras.io. With some aditional QOL features it serves me as the long awaited update.

### ![Voxorp-base-creator favicon](./other/voxorp_base_creator.png) [Voxorp Base Creator](https://kaabel.github.io/Voxorp-base-creator/voxorp-bases.html)
It is the second predcessor tool of Droneboi Vehicles editor and experiments with the full window rendering and canvas API, left in very early development stage. The game itself, [Voxorp.io](https://voxorp.com/) a space themed .io game, significanlty lost attention after the updates stopped, now stated as finished.

### ![Dr keys tool favicon](/other/dr_keys_tool.png) [Deltarealm Base64 Keys](https://kaabel.github.io/Deltarealm-b64-keys/)
...is the first predcessor of Droneboi Vehicles editor and as the first public repo, it later served as playground for experimenting also with SEO stuff, while revolving around file formats and base64 encoding which I've been playing with in the beggining of js programming.
